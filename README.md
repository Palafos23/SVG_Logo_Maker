  ## User Story 
     
  AS a freelance web developer

  I WANT to generate a simple logo for my projects

  SO THAT I don't have to pay a graphic designer 
  
  ## Acceptance Criteria
  GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input

  WHEN I am prompted for text

  THEN I can enter up to three characters

  WHEN I am prompted for the text color

  THEN I can enter a color keyword (OR a hexadecimal number)

  WHEN I am prompted for a shape

  THEN I am presented with a list of shapes to choose from: circle, triangle, and square

  WHEN I am prompted for the shape's color

  THEN I can enter a color keyword (OR a hexadecimal number)

  WHEN I have entered input for all the prompts

  THEN an SVG file is created named `logo.svg`
  AND the output text "Generated logo.svg" is printed in the command line

  WHEN I open the `logo.svg` file in a browser
  
  THEN I am shown a 300x200 pixel image that matches the criteria I entered
